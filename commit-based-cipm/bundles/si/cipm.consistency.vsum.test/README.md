# The cipm.consistency.vsum.test Plugin

This plugin provides test cases for the prototypical implementation of the commit-based CIPM approach.

## Tests for the TeaStore and How to run them

The plugin contains tests within the `TeaStoreCITest.java` file for the TeaStore as case study. The test cases differentiate between the integration of the initial commit and the propagation of further commits building upon the initial commit. Furthermore, it divides the history of the TeaStore in intervals based on its versions. As a result, there are test cases for integrating the versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3, and 1.3.1 as initial commits. Because only one version can be integrated at once and some test cases depend on other ones, all test cases are disabled per default, and only one case for the integration shall be enabled. Afterwards, the changes of commits between the aforementioned versions can be propagated. One test case allows to propagate the changes of every single commit while another test case propagates all changes of the commits at once. After the integration of the initial commit, the corresponding following commits shall be propagated, i. e., after the integration of, e. g., version 1.2, the changes between version 1.2 and 1.2.1 shall be propagated. To preserve the order of the propagation and to avoid potential `OutOfMemoryErrors`, it is recommended to enable and run only one test case in one test run. A test case is enabled by removing the `Disabled` annotation of JUnit 5 from the test case or by converting the annotation into a comment.

__Please note: in Eclipse, run the test as `JUnit Plug-in Test`. Using a `JUnit` configuration, it will fail.__

Every test case performs several checks after the propagation of the changes to evaluate the result. The checks are divided into a dependent part directly executed after the propagation and an independent part which shall be executed independent of the propagation because it loads multiple models into the working memory and can cause an `OutOfMemoryError` if it is executed with the propagation. Therefore, every test case contains two statements. The default not-commented statement executes the propagation and dependent evaluation. The second commented statement executes the independent evaluation. After the propagation has been performed, the independent evaluation can be run by removing the comment for the second statement and putting the first statement in a comment. Both statements shall be never active at the same time.

Additional files for the TeaStore-specific test execution are located in the `teastore-exec-files` directory.
