/**
 * An interface to be implemented by initialisers. Initialisers are interfaces
 * or classes, which are meant to instantiate objects (designated objects) via
 * {@link #instantiate()}. For intuition, their names can be used to denote what
 * they instantiate. <br>
 * <br>
 * Initialisers can also implement (default) methods that modify their
 * designated objects. It is suggested to have such modification methods return
 * something that indicates whether they ran as expected. <b>In general,
 * modification methods DO NOT check, if the object that is being modified
 * (modification target) is null. Attempting to use null as modification target
 * will result in EXCEPTIONS.</b> The reason behind this is the importance of
 * knowing if the modification target is null, as this could hint towards faulty
 * code.<br>
 * <br>
 * addSomething(...) methods have null checks for the passed parameters other
 * than the modification target (i.e. modification parameters), which are used
 * to perform modifications. By default, it is assumed that no null elements can
 * be added to modification targets via addSomething(...). If modification
 * parameters are null, no modification will be performed and the method will be
 * assumed to have run as expected, since no modification was performed and
 * failed. setSomething(...) methods, on the other hand, allow setting
 * attributes of the modification target to null. <br>
 * <br>
 * It is recommended to separate instantiation and initialisation (modification)
 * methods, as doing so will allow using the individual methods in sub-types.
 * Implementing initialisers similar to their designated objects, in terms of
 * type hierarchy and what modifications they allow from outside, may make
 * initialisers more flexible and ease implementing them. <br>
 * <br>
 * A further suggestion is to not declare attributes in the concrete
 * implementors, so that all functionality is present in form of methods. This
 * alleviates having to declare unnecessary attributes in sub-types and makes
 * overriding behaviour easier, since default methods can be overridden in
 * interfaces. If initialisation of the designated objects is complex, consider
 * realising it in form of initialiser adaptation strategies (see the links
 * below). <b>Note that calling {@link #initialise(Object)} in addition to
 * {@link #instantiate()} is necessary for the said initialiser strategies to be
 * used. </b> <br>
 * <br>
 * This interface also contains some static utility methods.
